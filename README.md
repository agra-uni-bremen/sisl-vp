# symex-vp

A RISC-V RV32 virtual prototype based on [riscv-vp][riscv-vp github] with [symbolic execution][wikipedia symex] support.

## About

This software allows symbolic execution (or more specifically concolic
testing) of software compiled for RISC-V RV32. Registers or memory values can
be marked symbolic explicitly using an intercepted `ECALL` instruction
or by introducing symbolic values through a provided SystemC TLM-2.0
extension. Branches based on introduced symbolic values are tracked and
as soon as execution terminates new assignments for symbolic variables
are determined, which discover new paths through the program, by negating
encountered branch conditions (Dynamic Symbolic Execution). For each new
assignment, the SystemC simulation is restarted from the beginning.
After all encountered branches have been negated, the virtual prototype
terminates.

Errors are signaled by the executed software through a custom `ECALL`.
This `ECALL` can, for instance, be used in software `panic` handlers.
For each path causing an invocation of this `ECALL` a test file with
concrete input values is created. This test file can be replayed by
pointing the `SYMEX_TESTCASE` environment variable to it. It is also
possible to terminate execution upon encountering the first error using
the `SYMEX_ERREXIT` environment variable.

## Cloning

This repository is a mirror of a private GitLab repository. Used
submodules point to other private repositories which are also mirrored
on GitHub. In order to rewrite the submodule URLs properly, clone the
repository as follows:

	$ git clone https://github.com/agra-uni-bremen/symex-vp
	$ git config --global url."https://github.com/agra-uni-bremen/".insteadOf "git@gitlab.informatik.uni-bremen.de:riscv/"
	$ git submodule update --init

## Installation

This software has the following dependencies:

* A C++ compiler toolchain with C++17 support
* [CMake][cmake website]
* A recent version of [Z3][z3 repo] (`4.8.X` is known to work)
* [LLVM][llvm website]
* [Boost][boost website]

After all dependencies have been installed run:

	$ make

Executable binaries are then available in `./vp/build/bin`.

## Dockerfile

To ease installation a `Dockerfile` is provided. To build a docker
image from this provided `Dockerfile` use the following command:

	$ docker build -t riscv-symex .

Afterwards, run the docker image using:

	$ docker run --rm -it riscv-symex

Executable binaries are available in `/home/riscv-vp/riscv-vp/vp/build/bin`.

## Usage

Consider the following assembly example program:

	.globl _start
	_start:

	/* Make word (4 bytes) at addr 0x0 symbolic */
	li a7, 96 /* SYS_sym_mem */
	li a0, 0  /* address 0x0 */
	li a1, 4  /* 4 bytes */
	ecall     /* execute make_symbolic ecall */

	/* Load symbolic memory word into register a1 */
	lw   a1, 0(t0)

	li a2, 23
	blt  a2, a1, true
	addi a3, a3, 1
	true:
	addi a3, a3, 2

	li a7, 93 /* SYS_exit */
	ecall     /* Signal end of execution */

This example program contains a single branch instruction (`BLT`). The
program can be compiled using:

	$ riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc -o main main.S -march=rv32i -mabi=ilp32 -nostartfiles

Afterwards, execute it using:

	$ symex-vp --intercept-syscalls main

The `symex-vp` will discover two paths through this program. One where
`BLT` jumps to `true` and one where it doesn't. The value of the `a3`
register will differ in these two executions.

## Provided VPs

The following virtual prototypes are available:

* `symex-vp`: A very minimal virtual prototype, based on `tiny32-vp`
  from the original riscv-vp repository. This allows testing very basic
  bare-metal RV32 software.
* `hifive-vp`: A virtual prototype mostly compatible with the
  [SiFive HiFive1][sifive hifive1]. This allows executing software
  for embedded operating systems like [RIOT][riot website] or
  [zephyr][zephyr website] symbolically.
* `test32-vp`: This virtual prototype is intended to be used with
  the [riscv-compliance][riscv-compliance github] repository. This is
  primarily useful for development (e.g. during testing of new
  RISC-V extensions).

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be set:

* **SYMEX_ERREXIT:** If set, terminate after encountering the first
  error (see below) during symbolic execution of the software.
* **SYMEX_TIMEOUT:** This can be used to configure the solver timeout
  of the employed SMT solver, by default no timeout is used.
* **SYMEX_TESTCASE:** This environment variable can point to a test case
  file for replaying inputs causing an error. This is most useful in
  conjunction with `--debug-mode`.
